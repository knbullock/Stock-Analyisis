# Stock-Analyisis

##Overview of Project
The goal of this project was to create VBA code that would allow a user to quickly mine for specific data, and also organize and format the output to be easily read. More specifically, the project was to expand the view from just one stock, to the entire dataset in order to have a better understanding of each stock performance. 

##Results
Initially, when the code was only set up to focus on DQ, Steve could only make an informed decision about that specific stock even though the dataset held much more information. By editing the code to include more data, we are able to see that only two of the twelve stocks had positive returns for both years and overall stocks for green energy have not performed well year over year.

##Summary
-Refactoring code is similar to proof reading and editing a paper, it take a little more time, but the results are much more 
Concise and easier to understand. Refactoring is beneficial because it ensures that the code written is the most efficient 		and effective way to achieve the desired outcome. This becomes increasingly important when dealing with larger data sets because of file size and memory size issues. Also, refactoring gives you an opportunity to become familiar with how a code works if using existing code. However, there is a possibility that the functionality or the effectiveness of the code may be impacted when attempting to streamline code. 

-While working through Module 2, there were several instances that provided an initial code and then a more efficient version. Also is was clear once I had reached the end of the module that most of the code I had written in VBA was very messy and not easy to understand. It was important that I go back and streamline the code so it was easy to read for myself and others. Even though this took time, in the end it is beneficial.
